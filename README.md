# Personal Website

üåê **Live Site**: [mg-moni.netlify.app](https://mg-moni.netlify.app/)

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, experiences, and interests in software development, UI/UX, and low-level systems. I designed and coded this site to serve as a central hub for everything I'm working on and learning.

## Why I Built It

I wanted a space that reflects my technical growth and helps me track my progress over time. Having a live portfolio allows me to:

- Share my projects and work experience with others
- Document what I‚Äôve learned across different domains like systems programming, web dev, and design
- Practice front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Build a habit of maintaining an up-to-date record of my skills and accomplishments

## How I Built It

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** ‚Äì For structure, styling, and basic interactivity
- **Responsive Design** ‚Äì Works on both desktop and mobile
- **Font Awesome** ‚Äì For custom icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
- **Netlify** ‚Äì For deployment and continuous hosting
- **Customization** ‚Äì Adapted from a simple portfolio template and personalized every section

## Future Plans

- Add a blog or changelog to reflect new skills and project updates
- Incorporate animations and transitions
- Possibly integrate a CMS or add a backend for dynamic content updates
